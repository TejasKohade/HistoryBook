History Book Application

A history book application using Java Servlet, JDBC, and HTML/CSS/JSP is a web-based platform that provides users with historical information about events, people, and places. It is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in history, whether students, scholars, or general enthusiasts.
To create such an application, we have used Java Servlet, a Java-based web technology that allows for the creation of dynamic web pages. Servlets are server-side programs that handle requests and responses from a web server, enabling the application to interact with databases and other server-side technologies.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that provides access to databases, allowing developers to perform database operations.
And HTML, JSP and CSS for frontend design
